# Rhys
Rhys' Tech Report was written well and explained how API requests are handled, along with an example from the template website.
The report isn't as useful as a lot of the API code is generated for us, but is still good to know.
The Class Diagram contains all the needed entities, and links to the necessary mock entities.
The Kanban cards can be improved by having more detailed titles and could be broken down into steps more specific to the tech stack.
Overall Rhys got ranked 3rd as the submission is presented well but the information could be more detailed.

# Haiwei
Haiwei's S2 is ranked 2nd in the team in general as his Kanban cards set him apart, his UML diagram and tech report's overall quality were better than average.
His Kanban cards scored highest overall as it was most detailed with useful references to resources, but his time estimates were underestimates. 
His UML diagram were well formatted and coherent, but he did have entities that could've been mock entities.
His tech report was highest quality and one of the most beneficial ones, but he lost scores in independence as other members covered some layers of Spring Boot too.

# Garance
Her Kanban feature cards were a good level of detail, the cards had appropriate links and parent cards, they could've included time estimates for the smaller subtasks.
Her UML diagram was ranked as the most relevant.
It was also coherent, and specific to the feature, but included data types that aren't used in JDL.
Her tech report followed the agreed format and had good benefit by explaining the repository, but could've been more specific on the topic of JPA instead of the entire repository layer.
In most sections Garance was ranked as 3rd/4th leading to being ranked 4th.

# Mark
Mark was ranked 1st for M2, for contributing the highest quality work across the board.
His tech report on Angular followed the agreed format well, alongside providing accurate explanations on how the entire application's frontend works.
His UML diagram was coherent and time estimates on Kanban cards were regarded as best.
That being said, he could do better by referring to specific people's work (tech reports, for example) in his own Kanban cards, and spend more time expanding their content so that other developers may pick them up more easily.
Also, project-specific Angular examples would be better than generic ones.

# Talha
Talha's Kanban cards scored highly for time estimates and practicalities due to his correct time estimates for given tasks.
Talha could improve on his detail and references by more clearly linking tasks to personas and mock-ups.
Talha's UML diagrams scored well on conformance and formatting, but he could improve on his UML diagram’s relevance and coherence since his diagram did not refer to the agreed entities.
Talha scored well on specificity and benefit, since his report linked well to the project but his report did not utilise the agreed upon format.
Due to these factors, he scored 6th overall.

# Samuel
Samuel’s S2 submission went well in terms of the benefit of his report, the topic of JDL was essential in getting everyone to understand the basic syntax and use of JDL, so that everyone was able to generate their UML diagrams based on their features.
In terms of improvement, Samuel could have put more detail into the Kanban cards, perhaps referencing issues that may be related to another’s teammates issue.
Also the tech report he could have used a more aesthetically pleasing format, which potentially could make the report easier to follow.
Samuel was ranked 5th overall for these reasons.

# Taziba
Taziba's S2 submission was poor based on the rankings of the team.
His Kanban cards did not meet the requirements as well as the others and his time estimates were the least realistic which he should work on.
He could also work on his level of detail and subject of them.
His UML diagram followed the agreed format and was coherent with the rest of the team.
His tech report on docker scored very low as it failed in areas of specificity and general report requirements.
Taziba was ranked 7th(Last) overall for the reasons stated above.
