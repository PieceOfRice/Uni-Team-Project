## Feature Script:
My feature was tournament creation and edit tournament was a subset of this. The create tournament page displays all the fields needed to create a tournament the user has the option to switch to a more detailed creation view and add to fields that aren't required. The edit tournament page displays fields relevant to the current status of the tournament e.g. if the tournament has already started the start dates, bracket types can't be modified. To access the create tournament page the user must be logged in, to access the edit tournament page the user must either be logged in as the creator of the tournament or be an admin. 

The front-end is responsive to all zoom levels and widths, the appearance of changes in response to options the user has selected. In create tournament fields are visible depending on whether or not detailed or basic creation is selected. Fields that require validation display error messages if it doesn't meet the requirements. Text input fields have a hint underneath which displays the character limit and how many characters they have entered. The user can also choose to upload a banner and can only upload image file types, when the banner is selected it appears underneath the button. For the create/edit button to be selectable or the required inputs fields must be filled and must be valid.

In creation backend is used to insert a new tournament to the database using a DTO for the tournament and a view model for any selected venue accessibilities, the backend is also used to check if the tournament name selected is unique, the backend also adds the id of the creator to the object. In edit the backend is used to retrieve the relevant record from the database and updates it on submission.

## A11y Script:
The page is responsive to zoom levels allowing users to view in a larger font size if required, the page is also responsive to screen size as well so can be viewed on both smaller and larger screens. Every element is reachable via tab navigation. Screen readers are functional on both pages as well.
