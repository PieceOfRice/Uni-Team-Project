I was ranked last due to two factors: my initial mockup was aesthetically the lowest quality - focusing a lot more on structure and layout than presentation; my persona was ranked third for usefulness, due to the lack of a frustrations section.
That being said, after communication with my team and more work, the new set of mockups and persona improved on those flaws, and are lot more consistent with the rest of my team's work quality.
