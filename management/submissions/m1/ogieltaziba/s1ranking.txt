I was ranked third based on 2 factors. In terms of aesthetics I was ranked best as I focused on the beauty of the mockup as well as user functionality. However in terms of my persona I was ranked last as the rest of my teams personas were more useful to the project. After receiving feedback I have now fixed the flaws and made both my mockups and personas more cohesive and coherent.
