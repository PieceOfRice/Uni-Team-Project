The team has ranked Talha's S1 Submission as fourth. Talha's mockup was ranked 6th, due to a poor aesthetic appearance and a lack of believable features. The UI is very cluttered and the colours used are dull. On the other hand, Talha's persona was ranked 2nd, since it included necessary information on goals and the features the person requires.
